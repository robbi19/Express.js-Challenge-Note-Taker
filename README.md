#### Summary 
```
The application frontend has already been created, it's your job to build the backend and connect the two.
The following HTML (5) routes should be created:
1 - GET /notes - Should return the notes.html file.
2 - GET * - Should return the index.html file
The application should have a db.json file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the fs module.
The following API routes should be created:
3 - GET /api/notes - Should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON.
4 - POST /api/notes - Should recieve a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client.
5 - DELETE /api/notes/:id - Should recieve a query paramter containing the id of a note to delete. This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
